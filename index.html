	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm 23 years old and orginally from Laos. I grew up in a small city. I had spent 19 years of my life living in Laos and decided to move abroad to find experience and dicover new things. I would describe myself as a very optimistic person as I like to bring happiness and make people laugh and smile.

	<h2>My Experience</h2>
	<p>During the summer of 2019 I had an opportunity to get an internship to in Hong Kong. As a Real Estate Intern, I spent the first half of my time focusing on understanding the key aspects of the distressed credit and real estate investment business. Specifically, I produced market research and investment models on the commercial, residential and land market segments. Growing up as a confident person, I have always had a leadership experience whether in school, university or at work. Since I've been a good listener and capable of intereacting with people, I enjoy being a leader in a team.</p>
